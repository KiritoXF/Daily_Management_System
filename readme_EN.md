## Introduce

daily management system(DMS) is a personal web tool which could record everyday work and help you find out what kind of thing takes your time.

DMS is based on Vue2, iView, express and Mysql.

DMS is just a demo but the 'Daily' part could work well. You can also import and export csv file.

## How to use

1. clone this repository.
2. npm install
3. run '/server/db/origininfo.sql' on Mysql. (default db name is 'dailySystem' and port 3306, username and password both are root)
4. npm run dev
5. npm run server
6. http://localhost:8081
